# sy_chess_app
One of my early projects done while teaching myself C++ before uni, at least 5 years ago. A simple GUI with SFML, supporting the play (local, not networked) of a valid chess game, and replay of the last game played. To be honest, I don't remember getting as far as it seems I did on this!

As can be seen, not many project structure principles were followed, and I wrote this far before I was using any kind of version control. 

It was coded in the Codeblocks IDE, that came with the C++ Primer that I initially learned from.

Learned a decent amount from this, looking back through it briefly has been a journy for sure.

I'm not going to figure out how to get all this compiling properly again with SFML, presuambly that's moved on vastly from when I used it. Instead, I've put some screen caps from the most recent build under screencaps/
